# Allowed Commands for DeepSpace Agent

This repository enforces strict agent constraints. Read this document together with AGENTS.md and McAPI.yaml.

---

## Agent Constraints (Important)
- Allowed commands only: `create`
  - Do not use raw shell (e.g., `node`, `npm`, etc.).
  - Do not chain commands (no `&&`, `|`, `;`). Send one high‑level command at a time.
- Room scope only:
  - Active room ID is stored at `/app/container_vars.json` under `currentRoom`.
  - Work strictly under `/app/workspace/repo/<currentRoom>` (and nested `room-*` subrooms if any).
  - Never modify files outside the current room subtree.
- Outputs are auto‑managed by hooks:
  - Do not attempt to run bundlers; `template.html` is generated automatically on commit.
  - Do not attempt to run any git commands; this is handled for you automatically when you complete the request

---

## Widget Creation (Recommended path)
- Primary action: `create widget <template-id>`
  - Example: `create widget notepad`
  - Example: `create widget crm-workflow-guide`
- After creation:
  - Edit `template.jsx` and other .jsx files under the widget folder to implement behavior and UI.
- If the template exists in the library, the system scaffolds it; otherwise it creates a stub for you to modify.

---

## Prohibited Actions
- No shell/OS commands of any kind.
- No git commands
- No command chaining.
- Do not modify files outside the current room subtree.
